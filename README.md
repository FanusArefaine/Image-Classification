# Image-Classification
In this project, Image classification is conducted on multiple image classes.

## Goal of the project

 The main focus in this project is to develop a classification model. In this project we are given images of 11 classes where the training data are provided in dense matrix format and the training labels are provided as integers. The main task is to build a classification model the given dataset and provide the prediction for the test set data â€“ as a submission to Kaggle. 


## Dataset Information

As briefly stated in the above section, the dataset contains images of 11 classes. Provided datasets are features extracted from images where the training and test data are in dense matrix, and training labels are provided as integers. The training dataset in composed of images described as 887-dimensional vectors highly unbalanced and has 887-dimensional vectors composed by concatenating the following features: 

       - 512 Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features 
       - 256 Normalized Color Histogram (Hist) features
       - 64 Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features 
       - 48 Color gradient (RGB) features 
       - 7 Depth of Field (DF) features 

The training dataset contain 18000 records and the test data consists of 3000 records as described below: 

       - train.dat: Training set (dense matrix, samples/images in lines, features in columns). 
       - train.labels: Training class labels (integers, one per line). 
       - test.dat: Test set (dense matrix, samples/images in lines, features in columns). 
       - format.dat: A sample submission with 3000 entries randomly chosen to be 1-11.
